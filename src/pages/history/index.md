    description: >
      'In 1948, a young accountant with an entrepreneurial spirit, tired of monotonous clerical life in the public sector, resigns from his workplace in order to start a small business. In the center of Salerno, he opens a grocery shop, that quickly transforms into a wholesale of local produce and a coffee roastery.

      Within a few years, the roastery becomes the main activity of Giuseppe Greco: efficient and widespread distribution network ensures delivery of quality products to shops and bars throughout the province of Salerno and Potenza, even reaching parts of neighbouring Calabria.

      These were not easy times for distribution. It was difficult to reach more remote parts of Campania and Basilicata region, but the numerous "AlfaRomeo" vans of the Giuseppe Greco import roastery became an example of punctuality and reliability in the commercial world: even with the snow, coffee shops and grocery stores in the remote parts of Campania and Basilicata did not lack biscuits,liqueurs and many other produce that was not easy to find in other regions of postwar Italy. The logistic network was scarce: there werenâ€™t many supermarkets or bigger grocery shops like nowadays.

      Towards the end of the fifties, pasta and tomatoes were the key industries of Salerno, the city situated in the middle of the region of Campania. The Greco's company was on the leading edge of the rising roastery bussiness. They were the only coffee roastery to be included in "Salerno industrious " - magazine published by the italian Chamber of Commerce that listed largest and most successful businesses of the city.

      The company's growth led to the the next stage of development: more modern equipment was implemented, without compromising the quality of the product - always in line with the rigorous methods of artizan coffee production.

      After the death of the founder in 1978, Arturo, his son, decided to focus only on the import and roasting of coffee.

      Today the company is an important part of the history of coffee production in Salerno. Thanks to over 70 years of experience, it selects only the most exclusive coffee beans for its loyal customers - an intricate job, done by the passionate few who believe that the quality of the coffee blend speaks for itself.'
