  subheading: 'Quality and quantity have never got along. You only need to glance at “specialties”, the coffees of particular plantations, to realize that the best coffees are offered in small, sometimes very small lots. And the small lots are not suitable for large-scale processing: very good coffee is scarce.'

  subheading: La voglia o la necessità di scappare che portano a prepararlo in un istante, di corsa. Nei caffè, un tempo luoghi di incontro, di cultura, di amicizia, specchi di uno stile di vita andante e colloquiale una volta il caffè si assaporava. Ora si tracanna.

    - title: 1. The Method

        'It is the most common method of preparation in Italy: the water, inserted into the base of the Moka machine, is pushed by the steam trough the filter filled with the coffee poweder.'

    - title: 2. How to Store Coffee
      description: >
        PCoffee does not like the cold. Keep it tightly closed in a jar at room temperature. If you have an excessive supply it can be kept in the refrigerator, remembering that the coffee easily absorbs moisture and odors: it must always be kept tightly closed. Before using it agin it’s necessary to bring it back to room temperature before use: the coffee is rich in aromatic oils that solidified at low temperatures.

    - title: 3. Whole coffee beans? Get the grind size right
      description: >
        The filter must be fully filled with the coffee powder: the right quantity of coffee is from six to eight grams per cup. Remember also that grind size of coffee is very important in order to obtain a full-bodied aromatic coffee.

    - title: 4. The Preparation
      description: >
        Put and keep the heat low: the water must pass through the filter of the Moka machine in a smooth manner. Don't rush, haste spoils the coffee. Check and periodically replace the rubber gasket: even a very small leak can compromise the pressure of the water and the quality of your coffee.
